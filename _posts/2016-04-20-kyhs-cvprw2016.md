## Abstract

The goal of this work is to discover objects of joint attention, i.e., objects being viewed by multiple people using head-mounted cameras and eye trackers. Such objects of joint attention are expected to act as an important cue for understanding social interactions in everyday scenes. To this end, we develop a commonality-clustering method tailored to first-person videos combined with points-of-gaze sources. The proposed method uses multiscale spatiotemporal tubes around points of gaze as a candidate of objects, making it possible to deal with various sizes of objects observed in the first-person videos. We also introduce a new dataset of multiple pairs of first-person videos and points-of-gaze data. Our experimental results show that our approach can outperform several state-of-the-art commonality-clustering methods.
