# Research Interest
**Computer Vision (First-Person Vision), and Machine Learning (Federated Learning)**

I like to use wearable cameras for various human sensing problems. Much of my recent work has focused on how we can utilize multiple wearable cameras collectively for analyzing group activities.

[>> Datasets for First-Person Vision](/fpv_data.html)

I am also interested in decentralized training such as Federated Learning, which utilizes distributed data and computational resources of multiple client devices to enable a large-scale training.
