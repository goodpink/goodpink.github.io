# Research Interest
**Computer Vision (First-Person Vision) and Machine Learning (Federated Learning)**

I like to use wearable cameras for various human sensing problems. Much of my recent work has focused on how we can utilize multiple wearable cameras collectively for analyzing group activities.

I am also interested in decentralized learning such as Federated Learning, which utilizes data and computational resources distributed over a large number of client devices to enable a large-scale training.
